I'm creating a pitch deck for my startup - MindOS : Learn Everything, Scientifically, Fastly - that will help people to learn / remember / master anything science backed techniques with this platform will provide that tools that is implemented using the techniques. for the 15 techniques you told me suggest me the best ways to add tools for students every category (junior, 6-8, 9-10, 11-12, boards, JEE/NEET, College Students) and everyone which will help them retain there semester data - one of example is that people will create a project(rename it ac to project) - project will have a personal onboarding , it will ask like time you have to master this topic , will create project plan with subtopics and we will also increase the project completion percentage (on onboarding questions things related to project name , for = (mid sem in 1 week(will create a plan to learn things faster), if its start of the semester then (it will create plan with using all the tools which is embedded with the scientific techniques for it) ))
Also suggest the tools we can build inside and outside a project (the best ui/ most imp. ux and flows) like the tools we have like space repeatation then we will add features like Anki, SuperMemo has and also we can connect to users google calender and shedule reminders and other stuff, this is example of one tool , we can create several tools, like people can generate quizzes and for active recall and we will complete the persentage of complition of the project ac to the question answer and , we will also have a tool where we will search the exact videos/playlist/online-resources/websites/urls/drive-links that will be helpfull for that topics(this is very good tool sololy), they can also create a mindmap without looking at notes and upload it or write it there then we will give feedback on it (all using ai openai -api) and it will also complete the tasks in the project and the project progress (it will gamify the playform and will increase the usage and interest of student ) - also suggest me the tools that that must be added init
